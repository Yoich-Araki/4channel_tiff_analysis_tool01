MATLAB batch analysis pipeline for four-channel STED images.
For each image, the pipeline generates normalized intensity views, contrast-enhanced LUT-applied views, and Otsu-thresholded binary representations.
Pairwise and triple-channel intensity overlaps are quantified after channel-wise normalization, where overlap coefficients are defined as the integrated pixel-wise minimum intensity.
All visualization panels and overlap coefficients are automatically saved, enabling reproducible batch-level analysis.
